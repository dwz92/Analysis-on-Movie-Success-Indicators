# Analysis on Movie Success Indicators

## Overview

This repo examining various factors that might influence a movie's performance and how they can be quantified and modeled. We study the variables contributing to movie success, focusing on the interplay between a moviesâ€™ genre, number of theaters showing, the moth of release, and the year of premiere, particularly in the context of the pre and post-COVID-19 era, spanning from 2019 to 2022.

For those interested in acquiring the datasets, please all R scripts within the repo.


## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data/raw_data` contains the raw data as obtained from X.

-   `model` contains fitted models. 
-   `other` contains relevant literature, details about LLM chat interactions, and sketches.

-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download and clean data.


## Statement on LLM usage
