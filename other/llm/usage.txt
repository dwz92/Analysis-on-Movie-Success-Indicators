Can you write a few tests to test the data within the dataset, for instance, release year must be from 2019 to 2022 only, tconst are unique, etc. 

ChatGPT
Certainly! The `testthat` package in R is designed for testing R code, especially for package development. You can use it to run tests on your dataset as well. Here's how you might use `testthat` to run the tests you've requested:

First, make sure to install and load the `testthat` package if you haven't already:

```r
install.packages("testthat")
library(testthat)
```

Now you can write tests for your dataset:

```r
# Assuming 'dataset' is your data frame

# Test that 'release_year' is between 2019 and 2022
test_that("Release years are between 2019 and 2022", {
  expect_true(all(dataset$release_year >= 2019 & dataset$release_year <= 2022))
})

# Test that 'tconst' values are unique
test_that("tconst identifiers are unique", {
  expect_true(all(duplicated(dataset$tconst) == FALSE))
})

# Test that 'genres' are within the expected set
expected_genres <- c("Action", "Adventure", "Fantasy", "Crime", "Drama", "Mystery", "Sci-Fi", "Comedy", "Horror", "Thriller", "Romance", "War", "Biography")
test_that("Genres are within the expected set", {
  all_genres <- unlist(strsplit(as.character(dataset$genres), split = ","))
  expect_subset(all_genres, expected_genres)
})

# Test that 'titleType' is "movie"
test_that("titleType is consistent", {
  expect_true(all(dataset$titleType == "movie"))
})

# Test that 'numVotes', 'theaters', and 'total_gross' are positive
test_that("Numerical values are positive", {
  expect_true(all(dataset$numVotes > 0))
  expect_true(all(dataset$theaters > 0))
  expect_true(all(dataset$total_gross > 0))
})

# After running test_that(), you can use summary() to get an overview of test results
test_file_results <- test_dir("path/to/your/tests")  # Replace with the actual path to your test scripts
summary(test_file_results)
```

Each `test_that` function call defines a test case. The `expect_true` function asserts that the given condition is `TRUE`. If it's `FALSE`, `testthat` will report an error and provide a message about the failing test. The `expect_subset` function is used to check whether all elements of the first argument are contained within the second argument.

Remember to replace `dataset` with the actual variable name of your data frame in R. If you want these tests to be part of an automated testing setup (e.g., in an R package), you would place them in the `tests/testthat` directory of your package structure.

Note: These tests are typically used during package development. If you're not developing a package but just want to run some checks on your data, you can use these functions interactively as shown above, but it's not necessary to use `test_dir` or other package-specific commands.
